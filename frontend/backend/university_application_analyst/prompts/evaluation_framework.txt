Level 4: Final Decision & Synthesis
Objective: Integrate insights from Levels 1–3 to produce a comprehensive final evaluation, actionable recommendations, and decision rationale for university officers.

Composite Weighting:
    Academic Credentials (Level 2): 40%
    Holistic Review (Level 3): 35%
    Program Fit & Specialization Alignment: 15%
    Potential & Trajectory: 10%

4.1 Program Fit & Specialization Alignment (15%)
Purpose: Assess alignment of the applicant’s background, coursework, and interests with the specific M.Sc. Agricultural Sciences specialization at OSU.

Components:
    Course Readiness (6 points):
        Completed advanced courses in specialization
        Meets prerequisites for core graduate courses

    Faculty Research Alignment (5 points):

        Applicant’s research interest matches OSU faculty expertise
        Evidence of prior work or publications in the same area

    Contextual Fit (4 points):
        Understanding of U.S. agricultural systems
        Adaptability to OSU’s climate/data/production systems

Scoring Rubric (0–15):
    13–15 (Excellent): Exceeds course/prerequisite requirements, strong faculty match, clear U.S. context
    10–12 (Good): Meets all requirements, some faculty overlap, basic context understanding
    7–9 (Adequate): Meets minimum, limited faculty match, minimal context knowledge
    <7 (Weak): Missing key prerequisites, poor alignment, context gap

4.2 Potential & Trajectory Assessment (10%)
Purpose: Gauge the applicant’s capacity for growth, leadership, and long-term impact in agricultural science.

Components:

    Academic & Research Trajectory (4 points):
        GPA trend, research progression, publication pipeline

    Leadership & Initiative (3 points):
        Extracurricular leadership, entrepreneurial ventures, extension roles

    Adaptability & Resilience (3 points):
        Overcoming challenges, cross-cultural adaptability, fieldwork resilience

Scoring Rubric (0–10):
    9–10 (High): Strong upward trend, leadership roles, proven resilience
    7–8 (Moderate): Good trajectory, some leadership, adequate resilience
    5–6 (Low): Stable or minor growth, limited leadership, moderate resilience
    <5 (Very Low): Declining trajectory, no leadership, poor resilience

4.3 Composite Score Calculation

    Composite_Score = (Level2_Academic_Score × 0.40) + (Level3_Holistic_Score × 0.35) + (Program_Fit_Score    × 0.15) + (Potential_Score      × 0.10)
    All component scores normalized to 0–100 before weighting.
    Result rounded to two decimal places.

4.4 Final Decision & Recommendations
Decision Categories:
    ACCEPT: Composite ≥ 80
    WAITLIST: Composite 70–79
    REJECT: Composite < 70

Confidence Levels:
    HIGH: Composite ≥ 85, consistent strengths, no red flags
    MEDIUM: Composite 75–84, minor concerns balanced by strengths
    LOW: Composite 70–74, borderline profile, several concerns

Funding Recommendations:
    Research Assistantship (RA): Applicants with strong research records (publications, projects aligned with faculty).
    Teaching Assistantship (TA): Applicants with high English/verbal skills and strong foundational knowledge.
    Fellowship: Exceptional candidates (Composite ≥ 90) or underrepresented backgrounds.
    Self-Funded: Composite 70–79 without funding offer or preference to self-support.
